        <h2>What Is SEO?</h2>
        <article class="art" id="art1">
            <p>SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” It is the process of getting traffic from the “free,”
                “organic,” “editorial” or “natural” search results on search engines.
                All major search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo have primary search results, where web pages and
                other content such as videos or local listings are shown and ranked based on what the search engine
                considers most relevant to users. Payment isn’t involved, as it is with paid search ads.
